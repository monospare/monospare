## 🚀 My Journey

Started as an Android developer, but not a hardcore coder. I was deeply curious. I loved exploring open-source projects, modifying them, rebranding apps, and turning one thing into something new. That experimentation excited me far more than writing endless lines of code.

On Fiverr, became a Level 2 seller. People assumed I was a hardcore developer.  
**Truth? I wasn't a hardcore coder. I was a hardcore executer.**

I knew how to take a client's problem, combine it with my problem-solving mindset and basic coding skills, and deliver real results fast. That's when I realized my core skills:
- I'm not the person who writes thousands of lines of code (honestly, it bores me)
- What excited me was rebranding, modifying, and turning one thing into something new
- I've always been techy but never a "coder"
- I'm the person who executes, solves problems, and makes tech actually work for people

### 💥 Why I Dropped Out
This mindset of execution over theory shaped Unwiring Tech®.
It’s the same mindset that pushed me to drop out of college, because sitting in classrooms and collecting degrees wasn’t for me.
Instead, I bet on execution, real projects, and building things that create impact.

And honestly, I’ve never regretted it for a second.
I’ve made lakhs, lost it, and made it back again, but it still stands as the best decision of my life.
Because it proved real growth never comes from theory, it comes from execution.

**Real growth comes from execution, not theory.**

## 🌍 What I'm Building Now

**Unwiring Tech® isn't just a company. It's a journey that began with a childhood dream.**

As a kid, I was always fascinated by technology. I used to open up toys to see how they worked, constantly experimenting to satisfy my curiosity. In 2005-06, visited my cousin's place in Delhi and saw a computer for the first time. It was a simple white box, but it felt like a portal to another world. Watching him play Road Rash ignited a deep fascination with technology.

Even though I faced financial problems, I never gave up. After years of persistence, I finally got my first computer in February 2011 (₹14,000, carefully assembled to fit budget)., I didn’t know much, like how to copy files, but I was determined to learn. Soon, I got better and started earning some pocket money by installing Windows on people's PCs. The shop where I bought my computer used to call me for installations. I still remember the Windows XP key.

The journey wasn't without challenges. When my hard drive failed, it led to restrictions on computer use. But passion finds its way. I would secretly use the computer at night, learning everything I could, even figuring out how to bypass the lock. Rooted my first Chinese phone and transformed it into a Lenovo, complete with custom bootloader. It was my way of making the most out of what I had, turning limitations into opportunities.

Founded Unwiring Tech® in Feb 2021 to "unwire" technology, making it accessible and less complex for everyone. Every product and service is crafted with the same passion that drove me from the beginning.

**Current Focus:**
- Building CroozLink | Helping creators and businesses get discovered. (Launching 25 Feb 2026)
